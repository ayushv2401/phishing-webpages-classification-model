# Phishing Webpages Classification Model

## Overview

A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models and deep neural networks on a dataset created to predict phishing websites. The dataset includes both phishing and benign URLs of websites, and from them, required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance of each model is measured and compared.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

Please make sure you have these packages installed in your Python environment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains both phishing and benign URLs, from which features are extracted for model training. The dataset is not provided in this repository but can be obtained from the original sources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ayushv2401/phishing-webpages-classification-model.git
   ```

2. Open the 'Phishing Website Detection Model.ipynb' notebook in Google Colab or your preferred Python environment.

3. Ensure that you have installed the required packages mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and train the phishing website classification model.
